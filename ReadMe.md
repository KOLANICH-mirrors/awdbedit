This is a git mirror of awbedit from https://sourceforge.net/projects/awdbedit/. It was inactive for a very long time. Formerly this ReadMe contained the information posted here by the original author, but this info got obsolete and was removed, and the style of the message was improved a bit to reflect .

The remaints of the original message
------------------------------------

There is a lot of cleanup work the original author used to want to take care of first, along with the new plug-in API changes. Once that's been done, the Award BIOS Editor can start to proceed to v2.0.

That's all for now. Thanks again, and happy hacking!
