We had to move to Codeberg
--------------------------
**We have moved to https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH-mirrors/awdbedit, grab newer versions there.**

Under the disguise of "better security" Micro$oft-owned GitHub has [discriminated users of 1FA passwords](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13/) while having commercial interest in success of [FIDO 1FA specifications](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download/) and [Windows Hello implementation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-in-windows-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422) which [it promotes as a replacement for passwords](https://github.blog/2023-07-12-introducing-passwordless-authentication-on-github-com/). It will result in dire consequencies and is competely inacceptable, [read why](https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH/Fuck-GuanTEEnomo).

If you don't want to participate in harming yourself, it is recommended to follow the lead and migrate somewhere away of GitHub and Micro$oft. Here is [the list of alternatives and rationales to do it](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/49869). If they delete the discussion, there are certain well-known places where you can get a copy of it. [Read why you should also leave GitHub](https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH/Fuck-GuanTEEnomo).

Notice
------

This used to be a git mirror of awbedit from https://sourceforge.net/projects/awdbedit/. It was inactive for a very long time. Formerly this ReadMe contained the information posted here by the original author, but this info got obsolete and was removed, and the style of the message was improved a bit to reflect .

The remaints of the original message
------------------------------------

There is a lot of cleanup work the original author used to want to take care of first, along with the new plug-in API changes. Once that's been done, the Award BIOS Editor can start to proceed to v2.0.

That's all for now. Thanks again, and happy hacking!
